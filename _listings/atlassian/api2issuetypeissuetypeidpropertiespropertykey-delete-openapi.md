      summary: Bulk set issue property
      description: |-
        Allows to set a property for all issues identified by a given filter. Only entities the user has permissions to edit will be updated.

        Currently the following filters are available:

        *   **entityIds** \- A list of issues to update. Only issues with ids from this list will be considered for updating. This is an optional filter, if not provided, then any editable issue that matches all other filters will be updated.
        *   **currentValue** \- If provided, then only issues with the property currently set to that value will be updated.
        *   **hasProperty** \- If true, then only existing properties will be updated. If false, then only issues that do not have any value associated with this property will be updated. If omitted, the property will be set on all issues, regardless of whether it previously existed or not.

        If more than one filter is given, then they are all joined with the logical "and", that is: only issues that satisfy all filters are updated. If no filters are provided at all, then the property will be updated on _all_ issues editable by the caller (i.e. issues in projects with the EDIT_ISSUES permission).

        If an invalid combination of filters is provided, an error will be returned by the API. For example, specifying the current value and "hasProperty" to "false" would never match any issues (as it would mean: update this property if the current value is something, oh, but only if there is no value at all) and is therefore not allowed.

        This method is [asynchronous](#async), meaning that it will not return the results immediately, instead creating a task to perform the requested update operation (unless preliminary validation, e.g. of the provided filter, fails).

        The operation is transactional: either all eligible issues are updated, or none (if there are any errors).

        Returns a full representation of the issue for the given issue key.

        The issue JSON consists of the issue key and a collection of fields. Additional information like links to workflow transition sub-resources, or HTML rendered values of the fields supporting HTML rendering can be retrieved with `expand` request parameter specified.

        The `fields` request parameter accepts a comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. It can be used to retrieve a subset of fields. By default all fields are returned in the response. A particular field can be excluded from the response if prefixed with a "-" (minus) sign. Parameter can be provided multiple times on a single request.

        By default, all fields are returned in the response. Note: this is different from a JQL search - only navigable fields are returned by default (`*navigable`).

      description: |-
        Add one or more attachments to an issue.

        This resource expects a multipart post. The media-type multipart/form-data is defined in RFC 1867. Most client libraries have classes that make dealing with multipart posts simple. For instance, in Java the Apache HTTP Components library provides a [MultiPartEntity](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpmime/apidocs/org/apache/http/entity/mime/MultipartEntity.html) that makes it simple to submit a multipart POST.

        In order to protect against XSRF attacks, because this method accepts multipart/form-data, it has XSRF protection on it. This means you must submit a header of X-Atlassian-Token: no-check with the request, otherwise it will be blocked.

        The name of the multipart/form-data parameter that contains attachments must be "file"

        A simple example to upload a file called "myfile.txt" to issue REST-123:

        curl -D- -u admin:admin -X POST -H "X-Atlassian-Token: no-check" -F "file=@myfile.txt" http://myhost/rest/api/2/issue/TEST-123/attachments
